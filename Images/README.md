## Concepts
I have mentioned different types of using images in Xamarin project with example code for both C# and XAML code.

## Implementation
I have put an [article](https://medium.com/a-developer-in-making/how-to-work-with-images-in-xamarin-forms-852e2420fb18) about how to work with images in Xamarin Forms in detail in Medium.
